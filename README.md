The 'annotations' ingredient is designed to extend EPrints 3.4 by allowing users to associate notes with various parts of the EPrints system.

These notes are currently simple text fields associated with a page, or with a field in a workflow.
Or they can be a threaded discussion associated or embedded within a page.

Future options include better support for provenance information, eg how an ORCID was filled in against an eprint.creator.
A note can be private or public, and has a type for querying and filtering purposes.

This code is currently at beta level, however its all additive so shouldn't affect other aspects of your installation.

jQuery is also required.
